# Provide LP

In order to provide liquidity, you'll first have to purchase either BEER or BARREL (have a look at our "[How to Buy BEER](../welcome-start-here/faq-getting-started/how-to-buy-beer.md)" section if you need help in doing so), depending on which you want to provide liquidity for.

Providing liquidity is possible on [SpookySwap](https://spookyswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0xf9525ee760D1859D77177D9A09B52cd81Ba005d3). Head over to the Liquidity tab on the left side of your screen. Connect your wallet (make sure your Metamask is on the BSC Network). Now you have to choose the tokens you wish to add liquidity with. For the first, select **FTM**. For the second, choose either **BEER** or **BARREL**, respectively.

If **BEER** or **BARREL** do not show up, please manually copy/paste the address as shown below.

**BEER**: 0xf9525ee760D1859D77177D9A09B52cd81Ba005d3

**BARREL**: 0xCA565e364ac8C48CBB3B2C95DD82d5AcA16F991c

Click on supply and accept the transaction in your wallet.

Now that you have provided LP, you can head over to [beerlovers.finance](https://beerlovers.finance) and [farm your LPs](https://beerlovers.finance/#/barrelstore).

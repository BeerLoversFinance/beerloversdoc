# Strategies

Congratulations! You've made it this far. Now that you're ready to start using BeerLovers Finance to earn some great yields, let's look at some basic strategies you can follow as a framework for your own investment strategy. We'll break things down by complexity and relative risk, so feel free to mix and match elements according to your own level of experience, investment goals, and risk tolerance.

The strategies described here are intended only to illustrate how to use the Beerlovers Finance protocol and **do not constitute financial advice**. Always do your own research and make your own decisions with regard to how you use BEER.

### Semi-active Restaking Strategy

Once you have familiarized yourself with the BeerLovers Finance protocol and how everything works, you might be interested to try a more active and advanced strategy to diversify your passive income streams and potentially increase yields.

One way to do this would be to buy some BEER and pair it with FTM to receive BEER-FTM LP tokens. (Refer to the [Provide LP](../helpful-guides/provide-lp.md) section for instructions on how to do this.) You can then stake those LP tokens in our [BarrelStore](../protocol/barrelstore.md) to earn BARREL, which you can then withdraw on a regular basis and stake in the [Brewery](../protocol/Brewery.md) to earn additional BEER when above peg and the Brewery is printing.

### **More Complex/Active Strategies**

As the BeerLovers Finance ecosystem grows, more complex, advanced, and active strategies will emerge. Once you fully understand the protocol and how all its mechanisms interact, feel free to experiment.

Keep in mind these fundamental aspects of the protocol when you are thinking about how to most optimally balance your portfolio:

1. The Brewery only prints for BARREL stakers **when the peg is above 10.1**.
2. The higher BEER is above peg, the **more BEER is printed for BARREL stakers in the Brewery**. This makes staking BARREL more attractive the higher above peg we currently are.
3. Conversely, BARREL becomes less attractive as BEER dips below peg.

Ultimately, the goal of an advanced user of the protocol should be to help maintain the peg. Doing so will result in the greatest rewards for not only yourself as an individual, but for every person participating in the protocol as a whole.

Strategically rebalancing your portfolio to apply buying pressure to BEER when below peg, or selling pressure when above peg, can be a very profitable strategy, but is not without risk. As such, this type of strategy is for experienced users only.

The easiest way to earn consistent yields with BeerLovers Finance is always in the autocompounding vaults. Everything they do you can do manually, but require significant time for monitoring and gas fees for every transaction.

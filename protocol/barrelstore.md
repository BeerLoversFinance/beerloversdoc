![The Beer Money farms currently available for staking LP tokens to earn BARREL rewards](<../.gitbook/assets/img3.png>)

To incentivize healthy liquidity pools for the Beer Money protocol tokens, our LP farms have been seeded with BARREL to be distributed as rewards to LP stakers across a time period of 3 months. The total BARREL rewards are distributed from each farm as follows:

* BEER-FTM LP: 50% of BARREL rewards
* BARREL-FTM LP: 50% of BARREL rewards

### **1. What will happen when the circulating supply equals the total supply? Will reward emissions stop?**

Yes. Once the max supply of BARREL (65K) is reached, reward emissions end. This will happen in exactly 3 months from when the BARREL farms started on March 17th, 2022. BARREL will always continue to print BEER in the Brewery, though, as long as BEER remains above peg.

{% hint style="danger" %}
BARREL reward emissions for the current LP farms are scheduled to end on June 15th, 2022 once the total BARREL supply has been distributed.

### 2. Why is "at-peg" (TWAP between 10 and 10.1) the best time to provide liquidity?

When BEER is pegged or close to being pegged at 1 BEER to 10 FTM, it is more akin to having exposure to a single asset (single staking) than to your traditional LP'ing experience, where you would run the risk of impermanent loss if one of the tokens went up in value and the other did not.

### 3. Wait, you mean that if FTM pumps, BEER pumps with it?

**Yes!**\
\
Let's look at an example:\
\
If FTM pumps in price, it won't "outrun" BEER, even if nobody is buying BEER at that time.\
\
The farm APRs will vary in terms of USD value, but the emissions won’t. This is something that wouldn't be possible with another 1:1 pegged asset like a stablecoin LP position, where the USD value is directly tied to the emissions. If FTM rises in USD value, BEER goes with it. Similarly, if FTM falls in USD value, BEER will be worth less in USD, **but it won’t affect the peg**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The only thing that can change the price of BEER in terms of its FTM value (and as such, the peg) is buying and selling it.
